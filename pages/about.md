## About the Collection

This is a brief collection of foods I encountered while living in Nagoya, Japan. One of the most striking things about Japanese culture is the care and attention to detail when presenting seasonal or representative dishes for a particular region. I chose a few of my favorite dishes from my onsen vacations during my winter vaction in 2013. I have also included some pictures that I just enjoyed eating:  

- Eat with your eyes
- Take in seasonal delights
The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
